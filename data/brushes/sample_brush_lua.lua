--	simple as can be.
--	the wash host application provides arrays of fixed lengths:
--	points_x
--	points_y
--	pressure
--	rotation
--	tilt_x
--	tilt_y

--	and some others TBD
--	probably will provide seeded randoms as well and maybe noise
--

--	probably will add some better type checking and safety later too, idk!

--	define a single function, render, that takes data and returns a stroke

function render(data)

end
